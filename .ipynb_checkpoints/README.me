Project Title: Text Generation Model using LSTM
Description
This project builds a text generation model using an LSTM neural network. The model is trained on a given text corpus to generate coherent text sequences. By learning the patterns in the input text, the model can predict the next word in a sequence, enabling the creation of new text in a similar style to the original.

Installation Instructions
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Install Required Libraries:
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or later). Then install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy tensorflow
Download the Text Data:
Place the text data file IndiaUS.txt in the specified path in the script, or adjust the path in the code accordingly.

Usage Instructions
Run the Notebook: Open and run the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

Results:

The model will process the text data, tokenize it, and create sequences of words to train an LSTM-based neural network.
After training, you can use the model to generate new text sequences based on a starting word or phrase.
Example Output: After training, the model will output a sequence of generated text that resembles the input textâ€™s style.

Additional Notes
Assumptions: This project assumes the input data is in English and is large enough for the model to learn meaningful patterns.
Data Source: The IndiaUS.txt file is used as the data source. You can replace it with any other text file by modifying the file path.
Model Hyperparameters: The number of LSTM units, embedding size, and other parameters can be adjusted to improve performance based on the data size and computational resources
